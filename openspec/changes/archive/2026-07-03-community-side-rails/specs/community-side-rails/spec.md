# community-side-rails — Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Desktop three-column community layout
From the `xl` breakpoint (≥1280px) the community shell SHALL render a centered
three-column grid — left nav rail (~240px), the existing 620px reading column,
right discovery rail (~280px) — with both rails sticky below the app navbar.
Below `xl` both rails SHALL be absent from the DOM and the current single-column
experience (including the ⋯ menu) SHALL remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Rails appear on wide viewports
- **WHEN** the community page renders at ≥1280px width
- **THEN** the nav rail renders left of the feed and the discovery rail renders
  right of it, and both stay visible (sticky) while the feed scrolls

#### Scenario: Rails absent on narrow viewports
- **WHEN** the viewport is below 1280px
- **THEN** neither rail is rendered and the page behaves exactly as before

### Requirement: Left nav rail exposes community actions
The left rail SHALL render shortcut rows: Đăng bài (opens the composer modal,
same overlay as the feed trigger), Bảng uy tín, Bình chọn, and Kiểm duyệt (links
to their routes). Each row SHALL show an icon and a localized label.

#### Scenario: Compose from the rail
- **WHEN** the user activates "Đăng bài" in the left rail
- **THEN** the composer modal opens with no route change

#### Scenario: Navigate from the rail
- **WHEN** the user activates Bảng uy tín / Bình chọn / Kiểm duyệt
- **THEN** the app navigates to the matching `/community/*` route

### Requirement: Right discovery rail surfaces existing community data
The right rail SHALL render three panels reusing the EXISTING mock hooks (no new
data sources): (1) Xu hướng — top trending posts (rank, title, like count) each
linking to its post detail; (2) Bảng uy tín — top contributors (rank, name,
score = upvotes − downvotes); (3) Bình chọn nhanh — the community poll with
in-place voting that reveals percentage bars after the vote (same behavior as
the poll page). Panels (1) and (2) SHALL include a "Xem tất cả" link to the full
page; panel (3) SHALL link to the poll page.

#### Scenario: Trending panel links to posts
- **WHEN** the user activates a row in the Xu hướng panel
- **THEN** the app navigates to that post's `/community/[postId]` detail

#### Scenario: Vote in place
- **GIVEN** the user has not voted in the rail poll
- **WHEN** they activate an option
- **THEN** percentage bars reveal across the options with their vote counted,
  without navigation

#### Scenario: See-all links
- **WHEN** the user activates "Xem tất cả" on the Xu hướng or Bảng uy tín panel
- **THEN** the app navigates to `/community/trending` or `/community/reputation`

### Requirement: Rail strings are localized
All rail strings SHALL come from `communityHub.*` i18n keys in both vi and en
(panel titles, see-all label), reusing existing `menu.*` labels for the nav rows.

#### Scenario: Locale switch
- **WHEN** the locale switches between vi and en
- **THEN** every rail label and panel title renders from the catalogs with no
  hardcoded strings
